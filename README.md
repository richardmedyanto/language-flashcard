# Language Flashcard
This project is based on the Day 31 project of [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code).<br />
To start the app, simply run main.py in python. I've included the CSVs of HSK1 to HSK5 for Chinese, and N5 to N1 for Japanese. You can go ahead and modify the code even further. Go crazy.
